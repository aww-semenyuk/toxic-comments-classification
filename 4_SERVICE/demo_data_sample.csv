64609,0,"Well let's see there, Clark.  Since President Obama has been our president, his administration saved the nation from going over the Republicans in Congress' fiscal cliff by jump starting the nation's economy toward recovery.  Instead of letting the nation's auto industry go bankrupt like Romney suggested, not only did Obama authorize an auto industry loan, but that loan was paid back in far less time expected and the industry has been thriving ever since.  Saving the auto industry kept millions of American families working.  The nation's unemployment rate was over 9% under two terms of Bush/Chaney and now it's down to 4.5%.  In the past seven years under the Obama administration there hasn't been long lines of unemployed workers spilling out into the streets like we've seen whenever there's a Republican in the White House.  President Obama's successes were done without the help of the Just Say No Republicans in Congress.  So much for voodoo economics, Clark!"

7329,0,"When prices in Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, and now other cities, are moving ever further above traditional levels vs. income, you have to look primarily at the excess demand from very well-off immigrants, and especially ""unofficial immigrants"" who come here on visitor's visas and stay forever.  We seem to have given up, assuming this cannot be stopped.  But we have every right to limit entry to the numbers stated in current immigration policy, and to accept based on the points system (skills, education, English/French),  We do NOT have to continue to let money buy its way into Canada. 
How can any federal Liberal look a young voter in the eye??  Their idiotic openness to rich quasi-immigrants means a 25 year old Canadian couple can't even dream of a little apartment in Vancouver, let alone a tiny little house in Burnaby.  An increase in supply and density would also help, IF accompanied by cutting off the foreign high-$$ demand.  Take immigrants from all over, by skills ONLY!"

87559,0,"Aloha. Regarding some of the specific items in some of the posts, I wonder if some of the points here are wholly accurate. Without going into detail, I believe the Morgan Report shed a lot of light on some of the items which oftentimes are overlooked or perhaps don't tell the whole story. Overall, I think that mistakes were made by many; both indigenous Hawaiian and others, that have led to animosity today. Both groups have points with merit from what I can discern from reading as much as possible on the topic. Clearly, both sides are emotional and there is a problem. That's why I like Keala's post.  That type of dialogue is encouraging as it takes the emotion out and looks for a solution based on mature conversations. The solution probably wouldn't come quickly or without airing of feelings, but with this type of goal in mind, a resolution would at least come.

If you know of a provision in the Constitution that says otherwise, please share it with me and others.  Incidentally, the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act, signed into law by President Nixon in 1974, established 55 MPH as the maximum speed limit, later changed to 65 MPH, and required sates to comply as a condition for receiving federal highway funds.  Nothing unconstitutional about it.   The national speed limit was repealed by Congress in 1995."

So the Bible teaches us not to remain anonymous when we judge that our brother or sister did something bad.

Christianity teaches forgiveness and mercy. How can the people ""unbad"" a post previously judged as ""bad"", which they want to forgive ?

It's one thing to argue that people with same-sex attraction have a right to sit at the same table as anyone else. It's another to argue that divine revelation has to be reworked to accommodate same-sex believers, especially if the evidence were to show that most same-sex individuals would have little or no use for the faith even if it were possible to accommodate them.

Here's why trails, parks, and other destinations are important and essential. Every year, 1 million visitors flood to Whidbey Island EAGER to spend their money to support the local economy. They willingly open up their wallets. 

I doubt an occasional jet flying, thousands of feet overhead, will deter anyone from visitor or have any health impact. 

There's a dramatically higher probability of an airplane crashing in the Bellingham, Everett, and Seattle metropolitan area than on Whidbey Island where there's only a handful of Navy aircrafts, private planes, and ultra-lights. One of the latter actually crashed across the street from my house.

It doesn’t represent the people. It will never represent the people and we’re going to do something about it.” (‘No anonymous sources,’ Trump scolds; Feb 24). The report added, “conservatives [are] happy to have a scrapper in the White House who’s often on their side.”

It was because of their vicious, unrelenting attacks on Barry Goldwater trotted out as “news” 53 years ago I soon realized the media are indeed the enemy. Five years later, while I was a river rat in the delta, I was thrilled when Spiro Agnew took on the media, having seen first hand how we were being portrayed back home as war criminals and baby killers.

Freedom of association cuts both ways: you can choose to associate with something, or choose not to. Other people can choose to associate with you, or not. Someone may want to associate with the Baptists, and the Baptists may choose otherwise. Within very broad strokes, the government isn't supposed to have any say in religion. You can't kill someone, then try to hide behind religious freedoms, for example.

While it is true that Anchorage takes up to 3 years to adopt the latest building codes - we just adopted the 2012 IBC a few months ago and have not yet begun to assess the 2015 IBC - that may give an incorrect view of the structural engineering practice here.  In recent code cycles, most earthquake structural design approaches have been unchanged.  Code changes continually tinker around the edges, but major changes are quite rare.

More importantly, our building department does a more thorough review of structural design than most places in the country, including California, Oregon, and Washington.  As a result, structural design practice here is probably as up-to-date as just about any of the cities on the West Coast."

 Clearly the Republicans realize that high voter turnout benefits Democratic candidates and, therefore, pass laws and develop voting policies and systems which suppress voting by minorities, the urban poor, the elderly, and ""new"" voters who, overwhelmingly, support Democratic candidates.  The GOP policy and practice is extremely simple:  If you can't convince people to vote for your candidates, develop procedures to keep them from voting at all.  It's a nasty, cynical tactic, but it's been all too successful.  

As the RG editorial notes, ""vote by mail"" eliminates all possibility of polling place voter fraud and would, more importantly, eliminate GOP voter suppression Gary Crum"

The result of investing in Canadian content is twofold; 
1) Canadian content producers can survive in an increasingly difficult industry for them.  Independent film is in its death throes.  The major studios are consolidating content and platforms.  Be honest - when is the last time you paid money for an independent Canadian feature film?  It's a brutal time for indie producers.

2) Tax credits act as an economic multiplier.  For every dollar spent, the economy boosts by more than that dollar.  It's economics 101 and should be encouraged.

$500 million USD is hardly a number to 'shrug off'.  It's a substantial investment.

Interesting to note that while Hamas still hasnt gotten around to changing its charter to recognize Isreal, Likud the Party of Netanyahu refuses to admit that a palestinian people exists, or that the Palestinians have the right to self-determination.

China's legal system is well-known to the world, certainly to Australia. Why suddenly cut the extradition treaty? All kinds of excuses but American control of the Australian Senate is significant. The Senate did what it was ordered. 

There is also the tied old case of western countries believing their culture, legal system, morality and military power superior than the east. So superior they blew themselves up in two world wars, and create such events as Holocaust.

The BLM announced the change after determining that the Obama administration proposal to withdraw 10 million acres in Western states “was unreasonable in light of the data that showed that mining affected less than 0.1 percent of sage-grouse-occupied range.”

There are no sagebrush focal areas in Colorado.

“The proposal to withdraw 10 million acres to prevent 10,000 from potential mineral development was a complete overreach,” acting BLM Director Mike Nedd said in a statement.

It was shocking and disgusting to watch.  

Now they are trying to ""find out the truth"".   The first order of business is to take care of themselves, and find a way to blame the democrats.  McConnell wants Merrick Garland for FBI Director.  Why?  Because then they could discredit anything coming from the FBI.  They will claim Garland is retaliating.  They won't impeach Trump.  They might want him to resign or focus on something else until this blows over but I think impeachment would hurt their image too much.  What Trump will do?  Will he say the heck with it and resign or will he double down.  It doesn't matter, in 2018, Americans will again keep Republicans in charge of both houses."

A hydrogen bomb is an order of magnitude worse; the heat, blast and radiation effects are unimaginably devastating.  Perhaps we can tolerate Kim Jong Un having missiles that can deliver atomic bombs, but under no circumstance can he be allowed to have hydrogen bombs, regardless of the costs and consequences of disarming him.  The time to act is now, before he has the ability to kill not tens of thousands of Americans but tens of millions."

Under this broken system not one Alaskan or smaller competitor has been able to drill and sell oil at a profit and the big three seem to own government, it should be a crime!

The smaller investors in Alaska's oil and gas Industry can not make money with so many stupid laws that are written when the legislators haven't slept properly and have not read and understood what they voted for!

To plug all the loopholes you'd need more than just political will.

A Jewish homeland was already in the works courtesy of Theodore Herzl and Balfour and Jews had a less than pleasant experience in Germany and in Poland many Jews who tried to return to their properties were murdered.
Furthermore, as I mentioned above in reply to someone (not you) an equivalent number of North African and Middle Eastern Jews were dispossessed of their homes and properties and settled in Israel.

our economy. Over the last 35 years, America’s policy choices have been grounded in false assumptions, and the result is a weakened economy in which most Americans struggle to achieve or maintain a middle-class lifestyle while a small percentage enjoy an increasingly large share of the nation’s wealth. Though these lived experiences and personal challenges are important, they are only the tip of the iceberg that is the crisis of slow income growth and rising inequality. To fully understand the scope of the problem, we must also examine the array of laws and policies that lie beneath the surface—the rules that determine the balance of power between public and private, employers and workers, innovation and shared growth, and all the other interests that make up the modern economy.
